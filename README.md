# Unsupervised : Identify-Customer-Segments
 In this the third project of Data Science Nanodegree Program, we apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify clusters of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segment of people can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. 
 
 The data has been provided by Udacity partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
